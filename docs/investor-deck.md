**Status:** Ready for customization

---

## Slide 1: Title

**AIAS Platform**

**Enterprise-Grade Automation for $49/Month**

*Build AI agents and automation workflows that actually work*

---

## Slide 2: Problem

**Canadian SMBs Waste 10-30 Hours Per Week on Manual Tasks**

- Solo e-commerce operators: 3+ hours/day on order processing
- Independent consultants: 10-20 hours/week writing proposals
- Real estate agents: 30+ hours/week qualifying leads

**The Cost:**
- 500K+ Canadian SMBs facing this problem
- $500-2,000/month opportunity cost
- Can't afford $150-500/month enterprise tools

---

## Slide 3: Current Solutions Fail

**Why Existing Tools Don't Work:**

- **Zapier:** $50/month for just 5 automations, too technical
- **Enterprise tools:** $150-500/month, too expensive
- **Custom development:** $10K-50K upfront, prohibitive
- **Generic tools:** No Canadian integrations (Shopify, Wave, RBC, TD)

---

## Slide 4: Solution

**AIAS Platform: Visual Workflow Builder + AI Agents**

- **Visual builder:** Drag, drop, connect. No coding required.
- **AI agents:** Intelligent automation (lead qualification, proposals)
- **Canadian-first:** 20+ native integrations (Shopify, Wave, RBC, TD)
- **Affordable:** $49/month starter vs. $150-500 competitors

**Time to Value:** 20 minutes from signup to first automated workflow

---

## Slide 5: How It Works (Sarah's Journey)

**E-Commerce Owner Automates Order Processing:**

1. **Signup (2 min)** → Choose 'E-Commerce' use case
2. **Connect Shopify (3 min)** → OAuth authorization
3. **Choose template (2 min)** → 'Shopify Order Automation'
4. **Customize workflow (10 min)** → Visual drag-and-drop
5. **Deploy (1 click)** → Workflow goes live

**Result:** Saves 10 hours/week = $500+ value/month

---

## Slide 6: Value & Outcomes

**Customer Results:**

- **Time saved:** 10-30 hours/week per customer
- **ROI:** $500+ value/month for $49/month cost
- **Mistakes eliminated:** Automated validation, zero errors
