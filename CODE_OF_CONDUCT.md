## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [hardoniastore@gmail.com](mailto:hardoniastore@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

### Enforcement Process

1. **Warning**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.

2. **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the project for a specified period of time.

3. **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
